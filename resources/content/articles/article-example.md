# My headline

When you build your site, **all of the keys** in the entire JSON file, or the header of the Markdown files, are sent to the Blade template as individual variables.

The template used is specified in the _view variable_ (*via the structure in your resources directory*). The ~fully-parsed~ HTML from the Markdown content under the heading area is accessible through a single variable called $content.
